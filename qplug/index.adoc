= QPlug Audio Plugin Library
:imagesdir: ./../../assets/img/qplug

== Introduction

QPlug is modern c++ library for building Audio plugins that target various
Audio plugin architectures. Qplug is designed to be easy-to-use and has a
clean, and simple modern c++ API.

== Design and Architecture

QPlug sits on top of the https://github.com/cycfi/elements[Elements {cpp} GUI library]
which handles user interface, and the
https://github.com/cycfi/q[Q {cpp} Audio Digital Signal Processing library]
for MIDI and digital signal processing (DSP).
Q provides the standardized realtime audio and MIDI streaming interfaces.

. https://github.com/cycfi/elements[Elements] is a lightweight, fine-grained,
  resolution independent, modular GUI library.
  You compose very fine-grained, flyweight “elements” to form deep element hierarchies
  using a declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse.

. https://github.com/cycfi/q[Q] is a cross-platform C++ library for Audio
  Digital Signal Processing. The Q DSP Library is designed to be simple and
  elegant, leveraging the power of modern C++ and efficient use of
  functional programming techniques, to simplify complex DSP programming
  tasks without sacrificing readability.

QPlug currently targets AU (https://apple.co/2WY3nex[Audio Unit]) and
https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html[VST3] using
https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2[iPlug2] as the backend engine. QPlug is
not a framework. It is a modular, and generic library, with loose coupling
between its layers and modules. It is for that matter that QPlug is
retargetable, with a clean, well isolated API which exposes a not-so-thin
abstraction layer on top of architecture-specific plugin frameworks such as
VST and AU as well as architecture-independent plugin frameworks such as
iPlug. It is possible to use other DSP libraries alongside
https://github.com/cycfi/q[Q].

// TODO: :pencil2: emoji
----
At one point, QPlug directly targeted Au and VST, before settling down to use
iPlug2 which already supports various plugin architectures.
