= Q Audio DSP Library

== Introduction

Q is a cross-platform C++ library for Audio Digital Signal Processing. Aptly
named after the "Q factor", a dimensionless parameter that describes the
quality of a resonant circuit, the Q DSP Library is designed to be simple and
elegant, as the simplicity of its name suggests, and efficient enough to run
on small microcontrollers.

Q leverages the power of modern C++ and efficient use of functional
programming techniques, especially function composition using fine-grained
and reusable function objects (both stateless and stateful), to simplify
complex DSP programming tasks without sacrificing readability.

Q is the host of some experimental Music related DSP facilities such as
http://tinyurl.com/y8cqt8jr[Virtual Pickups] (Virtual pickup placement
simulator) and http://tinyurl.com/yb49zlld[Bitstream Autocorrelation] (An
extremely fast and efficient pitch detection scheme) <<_the_author>>
has accumulated over the years as part of research and development, and will
continue to evolve to accommodate more facilities necessary for the
fulfillment of various Music related projects.

The library is Open Source and released under the very liberal
http://tinyurl.com/p6pekvo[MIT license].

== The Author

Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because almost
everything in music, his first love, is becoming electronic and digital.
Since then, he builds his own guitars, effect boxes and synths. He enjoys
playing distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own music in
his home studio.

Joel de Guzman is the principal architect and engineer at
https://www.cycfi.com/[Cycfi Research] and a consultant at https://ciere.com/[Ciere Consulting].
He is a software engineer specializing in advanced C++ and an advocate of Open Source.
He has authored a number of highly successful Open Source projects such as
http://tinyurl.com/ydhotlaf[Boost.Spirit], http://tinyurl.com/y6vkeo5t[Boost.Phoenix]
and http://tinyurl.com/ybn5oq9v[Boost.Fusion].
These libraries are all part of the http://tinyurl.com/jubgged[Boost Libraries],
a well respected, peer-reviewed, Open Source, collaborative development effort.
